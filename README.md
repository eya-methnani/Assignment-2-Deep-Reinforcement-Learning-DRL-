# Assignment 2: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

This README provides an overview of the second assignment for the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) course, a collaboration between ENSI and InstaDeep.

## Course Details
- **Instructor:** Wiem Khlifi
- **Co-Instructors:** Imen Jendoubi, Oussama Mahfoudhi

## Objective
The purpose of this assignment was to deepen my understanding of Deep Reinforcement Learning principles and their practical applications. I implemented and analyzed advanced DRL algorithms as part of this work.

## Assignment Structure
The assignment was presented as a Jupyter Notebook, which contained:

1. **Theoretical Background**
   - Brief explanations of the algorithms and concepts required for the assignment.
   - Links to supplementary resources for further reading.

2. **Implementation Tasks**
   - Step-by-step instructions to implement specific DRL algorithms.
   - Code skeletons and hints to guide implementation.

3. **Experimentation**
   - Instructions for running experiments with implemented algorithms.
   - Metrics to evaluate and analyze the performance of solutions.

4. **Questions and Reflections**
   - A series of open-ended questions to assess understanding and encourage critical thinking.

## My Work
I successfully completed the following:
1. **Implementation**: Developed DRL algorithms as instructed in the notebook.
2. **Experimentation**: Ran multiple experiments to evaluate the performance of my algorithms.
3. **Analysis**: Answered all questions and provided detailed reflections on the assignment tasks.
4. **Report**: Summarized findings, challenges faced, and lessons learned in a concise report.

## Evaluation Criteria
The submission was evaluated based on:
1. **Correctness**: Proper implementation of the algorithms.
2. **Performance**: Effectiveness of the algorithms in solving the tasks.
3. **Clarity**: Clear and concise code, well-commented and formatted.
4. **Analysis**: Depth of the answers to the reflection questions and quality of the report.


## Insights and Learnings
This assignment helped me:
- Gain a deeper understanding of DRL algorithms and their real-world applications.
- Improve my implementation and debugging skills in Python.
- Strengthen my ability to evaluate algorithm performance and analyze results critically.
